Configure React Router using createBrowserRouter in your main entry file (e.g., main.tsx), defining a root route that renders the main App component. 3. Create the App component to serve as the root layout, including a navigation bar with links to core sections (e.g., Home, Quiz, Students). 4. Set up nested routes for each main section, using React Router's Outlet for rendering child components. 5. Initialize Zustand stores for managing quiz state and student data, structuring the store to allow updates, resets, and selectors for relevant data. 6. Integrate IndexedDB (using a library such as idb or Dexie.js) to persist quiz and student data, ensuring Zustand state is synchronized with IndexedDB on relevant actions (e.g., on state change, load, or app start). 7. Provide context or hooks for components to access and update state and persistent storage. 8. Ensure all navigation and state management logic is type-safe and compatible with the existing TypeScript setup.\n<info added on 2025-08-05T09:42:42.075Z>\nAdopt the following 2024 best practices for integrating React Router v6+ (`createBrowserRouter`), Zustand v4+, and IndexedDB (preferably with Dexie 4) in your TypeScript application architecture:\n\n- Centralize all route definitions in a dedicated module (e.g., `routes.ts`) using `createBrowserRouter`, and provide the router to your app via `<RouterProvider router={router} />` at the root. Use nested routes and `<Outlet />` in the main `App` layout for section-based navigation (Home, Quiz, Students). Implement route protection with a `ProtectedRoute` component or route loaders for authentication as needed.\n- Structure Zustand stores modularly, creating separate stores for quiz state and student data. Define TypeScript interfaces for state and actions to ensure type safety. Use Zustand for in-memory state and Dexie for persistence, syncing state on app load and significant state changes (e.g., answer submission, quiz completion). Avoid persisting large objects directly in Zustand; instead, persist them in Dexie and hydrate Zustand from Dexie on app start.\n- Set up Dexie 4 as a singleton instance for IndexedDB access, defining explicit TypeScript interfaces for each table (e.g., `StudentAttempt`, `Answer`, `Score`). Use Dexie’s schema versioning for future upgrades and wrap all DB operations in try/catch for robust error handling.\n- On app initialization, hydrate Zustand state from Dexie by loading the latest quiz/student data and updating the store accordingly. On relevant state changes, persist updates to Dexie to ensure data durability across reloads and sessions.\n- Handle edge cases such as IndexedDB unavailability (e.g., private browsing, quota exceeded) by providing fallback UI or error messages. For multi-tab scenarios, use Dexie hooks to synchronize state changes across tabs.\n- For testing, write unit tests for all Dexie CRUD operations and integration tests for state flow between UI, Zustand, and Dexie. Use React Testing Library to verify navigation, route protection, and state-driven rendering.\n- Follow these patterns in your implementation:\n  - Navigation bar in `App` uses `<Link>` for SPA navigation.\n  - All navigation and state logic is type-safe and compatible with TypeScript.\n  - Lazy load heavy route components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for performance.\n  - Use error boundaries (`errorElement`) in route configs for graceful error handling.\n  - Expose context or hooks for accessing and updating both Zustand state and persistent storage from components.\n\nReference code examples and further details are available in the 2024 best practices guide for React Router, Zustand, and Dexie integration.\n</info added on 2025-08-05T09:42:42.075Z>",

Check that data persists across page reloads by saving state to IndexedDB and rehydrating Zustand state from IndexedDB on app load. 5.

Handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback if storage fails.\n<info added on 2025-08-06T02:30:11.132Z>\nPersistent student record lookup and auto-creation logic has been fully integrated. The `getStudentByName` method was added to `dbUtils` in `src/db/database.ts` to search for existing students by normalized name, and this method is now exposed in the student store (`src/stores/studentStore.ts`) with robust async error handling. The Landing component's form submission logic now checks for an existing student by name, creates a new student record with a unique ID and timestamp if not found, and manages loading and error states with user-friendly feedback. Unique ID generation combines a timestamp and random string to prevent conflicts. All storage logic is strictly typed with TypeScript interfaces, and the system is ready for integration with global state management.\n</info added on 2025-08-06T02:30:11.132Z>",
